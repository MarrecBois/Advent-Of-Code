# Advent-Of-Code

I've participated in Advent of Code annually since 2020, an event featuring daily algorithmic challenges each December. 
My GitHub showcases solutions from recent years, highlighting my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in Python. 
While I no longer have access to my 2020 and 2021 solutions, my continued participation reflects my commitment to refining my coding abilities.
If you are interested, here is the link to the advent of code site, where you can access the problems from any of the past years: https://adventofcode.com/2024/events
